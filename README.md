# Problem Statement: Motor Insurance Part Mapping and Recommendation

## Overview
In the heart of the bustling motor insurance industry, AutoSure Insurance had built a reputation for quick and efficient claim settlements. At the helm of the company was its visionary CEO, Mr. Aryan Mehta, who prided himself on maintaining customer trust and operational excellence. However, despite the company's efforts, a persistent problem was plaguing the claims department—inconsistencies in damage assessment and claim verification.
Whenever an accident occurred, AutoSure Insurance followed a well-defined process:
1.	A surveyor was dispatched to assess the vehicle’s damages and input the details manually into the company's system.
2.	The garage, where the vehicle was being repaired, also submitted its own list of damaged parts.
3.	The insurance team compared these two lists before processing payments to ensure accuracy and prevent fraudulent claims.
Challenges in the Current Process
However, critical issues arose in this process:
•	Inconsistent Part Names: Since surveyors entered damaged parts manually, there was no standardization. For instance, a surveyor might enter "Left Door", while the garage might list it as "Driver-Side Door", making it difficult to match the records correctly
